This week, I completed planning for a new ASCII non-combat roguelike themed around nuclear risk. The working game title is Deep Geo (a short-form of Deep Geological Repository).  You can read more about nuclear risk and why it matters, nuclear waste, etc. with the following links (which I took as insipration for my game design and goals):

- [Games for Change: Why Nuclear Weapons Matter](http://www.gamesforchange.org/2016/11/why-were-getting-serious-about-nuclear-weapons-with-epic-orphan)
- [Wikipedia: Radioactive Waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste)
- [Wikipedia: Deep Geological Repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_geological_repository)
- [Wikipedia: Waste Isolation Pilot Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant)

This week, I nailed down the theme and core gameplay; it consists of:

- Stealth mechanics (monsters have a field of view, and you need to stay out of it; patience while cloaked to avoid encounters)
- Non-tradiitional (escape/flee) combat style. There's no damage inflicted, but you can stun, sprint for a short time, push enemies, and cloak yourself (if you don't move).
- Puzzles. These may be switch puzzles (several switches operate several doors simultaneously), push-stuff-around puzzles, keys and locked doors, and items/parts you have to combine/use.

While there are some important, unanswered questions (how do you complete puzzles with  monsters breathing down your neck? Do we have experience and levelling up?), it's ready enough to start working on. So I'll start working on it this week or early next week.
